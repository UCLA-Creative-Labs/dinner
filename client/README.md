# Chef Client

The current directory is the base for all frontend code for [Chef](https://github.com/UCLA-Creative-Labs/chef.git).

To run the client, make sure you're in this directory (`chef/client/`) simply run the following:

```sh
$ yarn install
...
$ yarn start
```

A browser tab with the frontend should show up immediately; if not, simply go to `0.0.0.0:8080` or `localhost:8080` in a browser (if you want to test VR, you must use `localhost`).
